        <p>Created in 2021, The King's Gambit chess game provides a platform for users to play a game of 
            chess against another human player, play against an artificial player,
             or to watch a chess game simulation.

            the basics of the game. This tutorial mode guides new players through a 
            match using notifications, move hints, board highlighting and the ability to
            undo/redo moves. Detailed information about each chess piece is 
            also accessible within the tutorial mode.

             with additional help features allows players of any ability, 
             from novice to master, to enjoy the game of chess.
